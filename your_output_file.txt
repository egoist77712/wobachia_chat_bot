Vector-Borne Diseases Research Programme EHI’s Vector-Borne Diseases Research Programme conducts field and laboratory research to gain a better understanding of vector-borne diseases that pose a threat to Singapore, and to develop tools for risk interventions.  Vector control and surveillance tools The programme continually explores new and safe tools for Singapore’s vector control programme. It is currently studying the feasibility of using Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti males to help suppress the Aedes mosquito population in Singapore, to further reduce the risk of dengue transmission. Wolbachia are naturally-occurring bacteria present in more than 60 per cent of insects. However, Aedes aegypti, the primary dengue-transmitting vector, does not carry the bacteria. When female mosquitoes from the field – which do not carry Wolbachia – mate with males that carry Wolbachia, the eggs derived from these matings do not hatch. Theoretically, releasing males carrying Wolbachia could lead to a reduction in the population of Aedes mosquitoes in the field.  Previously, the team developed the Gravitrapthat enabled the capture of both Aedes female adult mosquitoes and their eggs. Gravitraps are currently deployed at public housing estates in various parts of Singapore, to provide an overview of the mosquito density in different parts of Singapore.  The team also carries out tests on the efficacy of insecticides and the resistance of mosquitoes to them. Such tests are conducted in both the laboratory and field, to ensure that the insecticides used continue to be effective in mosquito control.  The institute also serves as a repository and reference for mosquito species present in Singapore. Through years of collection from various habitats, we have accumulated a comprehensive collection of mosquitoes that is carefully catalogued and filed for easy reference.  vector-borne diseases research  Understanding Disease Transmission The programme seeks to gain an understanding of disease transmission, through studying the dynamic interactions between the pathogen, the vector and the human host.  EHI’s high containment Arthropod Containment Levels 2 and 3 laboratories (ACL-2 and ACL-3) allow mosquito infection experiments to be conducted, to further our understanding of mosquito-pathogen interactions, and the potential impact on disease transmission. Molecular epidemiology, as a result of the mapping of pathogen genes and genomes in the context of disease epidemiology, has provided further insights into vector-borne disease transmission in Singapore and the region. Together with our study on the seroprevalence of disease-specific antibodies in the human population, the multi-disciplinary approach provides robust situational awareness and risk assessment.  Similarly to with the Surveillance and Epidemiology Programme, pathogens studied in this programme include the dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and malaria parasites.  Wolbachia-Aedes Mosquito Suppression Strategy  Using male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti (Wolbachia-Aedes) mosquitoes to reduce the dengue mosquito population NEA’s Environmental Health Institute has studied various novel mosquito control methods, and has found that the Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology is most suitable for Singapore’s context. NEA’s Dengue Expert Advisory Panel (DEAP), comprising experts from Singapore, Australia, the UK, and the US, has also recommended that Singapore explore the use of the Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology to further reduce the risk of dengue. Results The heatmaps below show the “eraser effect” where previously dark red areas (indicating high Aedes aegypti mosquito population) gradually faded to low mosquito population after releases. Scientific studies will continue to evaluate the impact of the project and improve the cost effectiveness and deployment strategies for Project Wolbachia.   How Does Wolbachia-Aedes Suppression Technology Work? How does releasing male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes suppress Aedes aegypti populations? When male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti (Wolbachia-Aedes) mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their resulting eggs do not hatch. Diagram on Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology  Over time, continued releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes will lead to a decline in urban Aedes aegypti populations. This not only reduces the risk of dengue, but also of other Aedes aegypti-borne diseases such as Zika and chikungunya. The science behind Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology Read on for a more detailed look at the biology behind Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology. You’ll also find out more about the studies NEA has done to ensure that the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes we release will be effective at suppressing Aedes aegypti populations.  How does NEA mass-produce Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes for release? Wolbachia is maternally transmitted. Female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti pass the bacterium down to their offspring, thus generating a stable line of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Rearing this line in NEA’s mosquito production facility allows us to easily produce large numbers of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes for our releases, without the need for further egg microinjection. Refer to the NEA website to find out how NEA makes sure that the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes we release continue to carry Wolbachia. Production of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes How do we get a population of only male Aedes aegypti? Male and female mosquito pupae can be sorted by size, as male pupae are smaller than female pupae. How many male pupae are there in the picture below? Male mosquito pupae are smaller than female pupae                 Male and female mosquito pupae can be sorted by size  Why do matings between Wolbachia-Aedes males and urban non-Wolbachia-carrying females produce eggs that do not hatch? Such matings are biologically incompatible due to a phenomenon called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which is caused by Wolbachia. Refer to the NEA website to find out about more about CI, and how NEA confirmed that CI works in our Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Can our lab-reared Wolbachia-Aedes males compete with wildtype males for female mosquitoes? NEA’s studies have shown that Wolbachia does not affect the mating ability of our Wolbachia-Aedes males. Refer to the NEA website to find out about these studies.  Egg Microinjection How was Wolbachia introduced into Aedes aegypti? Aedes aegypti does not naturally carry Wolbachia. To introduce Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti, researchers had to inject it into Aedes aegypti eggs, eventually producing adult Aedes aegypti that carried the bacterium. As Wolbachia is maternally transmitted, the females then passed the bacterium to their offspring. Read on to see photos of this process.  Cytoplasmic Incompatibility Why do matings between Wolbachia-Aedes males and non-Wolbachia-carrying females produce eggs that do not hatch? When male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that do not carry Wolbachia, their resulting eggs do not hatch. This is because Wolbachia causes cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a phenomenon where sperm and eggs are unable to form viable offspring. Scientists are still trying to understand how Wolbachia causes CI, but it is thought that Wolbachia modifies sperm such that they cannot successfully fertilise eggs that do not carry Wolbachia.  On the other hand, females that do carry Wolbachia can produce viable eggs after mating with males, regardless of whether or not the males carry Wolbachia. As Wolbachia is maternally transmitted, the offspring (both male and female) of Wolbachia-carrying females will inherit Wolbachia from their mothers. This is how we are able to rear large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes in the lab.  Confirming CI in our Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes As the Wolbachia-Aedes suppression strategy exploits CI to suppress field populations of Aedes aegypti, we want to make sure that CI works in our male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Read on to see how we confirm this in the lab.  Maternal Transmission of Wolbachia How does NEA mass-produce Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes for release? Wolbachia is maternally transmitted. Female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti pass the bacterium down via their eggs to their offspring, thus generating a stable line of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Rearing this line in NEA’s mosquito production facility allows us to easily produce large numbers of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes for our releases, without the need for further egg microinjection.  How do we know that the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes we release carry Wolbachia? We conduct regular checks to ensure that maternal transmission of Wolbachia is stable in our Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito line. This gives us confidence that the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes we release do indeed carry Wolbachia.  Mating Competitiveness Can our lab-reared Wolbachia-Aedes males compete with urban males for female mosquitoes? To achieve suppression, the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes we release must be able to compete with urban males for female mates. Read on to find out how we ensure that Wolbachia does not affect the mating competitiveness of our Wolbachia-Aedes males.  Why Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology? Suppression or replacement? There are two major strategies in field trials today that use Wolbachia to reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.  Suppression strategy: This approach, which NEA is now piloting under Project Wolbachia – Singapore, aims to reduce mosquito-borne disease transmission by suppressing mosquito populations. It involves the release of non-biting male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes to mate with urban female mosquitoes. As these matings produce eggs that do not hatch, continued releases result in reduced mosquito populations. Besides Singapore, this approach is also being piloted by disease control programmes in Australia, China, Thailand, and the US, among other countries. Refer to the NEA website to read more about how this approach works.  Replacement strategy: This approach aims to replace field mosquito populations with Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes, which have a reduced ability to transmit diseases such as dengue. It involves the release of both non-biting male and biting female Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes, which then introduce Wolbachia into field mosquito populations. This approach is being piloted by disease control programmes in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, among other countries.  Why is the Wolbachia suppression strategy most suitable for Singapore? After extensive laboratory studies, literature reviews, and consultation with experts, NEA determined that the Wolbachia suppression strategy was most suitable for Singapore’s context. Here are some of the most important factors we considered:  Biological consideration: Our lab studies found that when introduced into local Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, Wolbachia only partially blocks dengue transmission. This may make the replacement approach less effective in Singapore’s context. A rise in mosquito population could theoretically negate the partial block, or even result in an increase in dengue transmission.Suppression approach targets the mosquito population itself, and does not rely on Wolbachia’s ability to block disease transmission.  Social acceptance: After decades of good vector control in Singapore, the release of female mosquitoes (required by the replacement approach) will increase biting pressure. Suppression approach involves the release of only male mosquitoes, which do not bite or transmit disease. Public education: The release of female mosquitoes in the replacement approach is at odds with Singapore’s long-standing focus on prevention of mosquito breeding, and may send mixed signals to the public. Suppression approach is consistent with Singapore’s decades of public messaging on staying vigilant against mosquito breeding.  Ecological: The replacement of field mosquito populations with Wolbachia-carrying insects may be permanent. It has been shown to successfully impede dengue transmission. However, subsequent suppression of Wolbachia-Aedes population cannot rely on the same Wolbachia-Aedes, and will require more time and alternative measure. Release of male Wolbachia-Aedes can be halted at any time and leaves no ecological footprint. Replacement with Wolbachia-Aedes can follow suppression if needed.  Wolbachia is Safe and Natural What is Wolbachia Wolbachia is a safe, naturally occurring bacterium found in more than 60% of insect species, including butterflies, bees, dragonflies and some species of mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. Organisms in the natural environment have been continuously exposed to Wolbachia for millions of years. Wolbachia CANNOT survive in the environment outside insect hosts  Wolbachia DOES NOT harm humans or animals Humans and animals have always been exposed to Wolbachia. This happens when they come into contact with insects, eat insects, or eat foods such as fruit that are exposed to insects. Despite this, there are no reports of Wolbachia causing harm to humans or animals. Wolbachia CANNOT be transferred through a mosquito bite Humans and animals are constantly exposed to the bites of female mosquitoes that naturally carry Wolbachia, but there are no reports of Wolbachia transmission via bites. A study found that human volunteers exposed to bites from female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti (Wolbachia-Aedes) mosquitoes showed no immune response to Wolbachia. Wolbachia CANNOT survive outside insects Wolbachia can only survive inside insect cells. Wolbachia cannot survive in the outside environment. When the host insect dies and decomposes, Wolbachia decomposes naturally together with the insect’s body. Wolbachia DOES NOT survive after being ingested There are no reports of mosquito predators (such as fish, lizards, and frogs) becoming infected with Wolbachia. A study found that spiders fed on Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes did not acquire Wolbachia. Is it safe to release male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes? NEA’s comprehensive risk assessment (see detailed reports below) of Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology has determined it to be safe, with no risk to human health and insignificant risk to ecology. This conclusion is consistent with findings from other groups around the world.  The risks associated with releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are low or negligible:  Low risk of community becoming less vigilant with source reduction. Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology is not a silver bullet, and is intended to complement, not replace, source reduction efforts. Continued community source reduction efforts are critical for the success of the technology. Negligible risk from temporary increase in male mosquito numbers following a release, as male mosquitoes do not bite or transmit disease. Negligible risk from unintentional release of female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Unintentional release of large numbers of female Wolbachia-Aedes is avoided with laboratory security and robust sex-sorting processes achieved through technologies developed with NEA’s partner, Orinno Technology Pte. Ltd. NEA is also collaborating with Verily Life Sciences LLC to use artificial intelligence to separate the male from the female mosquitoes with very high accuracy. To find out more about Verily’s sorting technology, please Refer to the NEA website. However, as sex-sorting is not 100% accurate, a very small number of female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes can still be released. This number is too small to have any noticeable impact on biting, and the ability of the females to transmit disease would largely be blocked by Wolbachia. NEA also takes the additional step of exposing sorted pupae to low-dose X-ray irradiation to sterilise any remaining females. This prevents Wolbachia from establishing itself in the mosquito population, as the small number of females released will not be able to reproduce. Prevention of establishment is important for the continued effectiveness of Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology, which relies on incompatible matings between Wolbachia-carrying males and wildtype non-Wolbachia-carrying females. Negligible or low risk of niche replacement by Aedes albopictus, the secondary vector of dengue in Singapore. Aedes albopictus prefers greenery, while Aedes aegypti prefers urban spaces. NEA’s vector population surveillance data indicates a low risk of niche replacement if the community continues to carry out source reduction. Negligible risk of endangering other species in the ecosystem. Mosquitoes typically make up a very small percentage of the diet of predators such as frogs, lizards, or spiders, and there are no predator species that depend solely on Aedes aegypti as a food source. Risk assessment reports To assess the safety of Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology, NEA conducted critical reviews of existing knowledge and research, and consulted international and local experts and stakeholders, including researchers, medical and healthcare professionals, and non-governmental organisations.  Male Mosquitoes Do Not Bite or Transmit Disease Male mosquitoes do not transmit disease Male mosquitoes feed only on plant juices, such as nectar, to get the sugar they need for energy and survival. As males do not bite, they cannot transmit diseases.  Female mosquitoes feed on blood Female mosquitoes, on the other hand, need protein from blood for the development of their eggs. To obtain blood, females seek out and bite hosts such as humans, and may transmit disease in the process.  Fun facts! Using a microscope or magnifying glass, here are three ways you can tell harmless male mosquitoes apart from female foes:  Males are smaller than females Compared to males, females have a more needle-like proboscis, which they use for biting Males have bushy, hairy antennae, while the antennae of females are a lot less hairy  Project Wolbachia Only Targets Aedes aegypti NEA’s Wolbachia-Aedes suppression strategy is species-specific Releases of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti (Wolbachia-Aedes) mosquitoes target and suppress only Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Singapore. Other mosquito or insect species are not affected by the releases. Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology therefore has negligible ecological impact.  Stay vigilant: Aedes aegypti is not the only disease vector in Singapore Did you know that more than 180 species of mosquitoes have been identified in Singapore to date? Most do not spread disease, but a handful do. Disease vectors such as Aedes albopictus, which can transmit dengue, and Culex mosquitoes are not targeted by Project Wolbachia. To prevent biting and reduce the risk of disease transmission, we must remain vigilant against mosquito breeding. Carry out the Mozzie Wipeout regularly to keep mosquito populations low.  The mosquitoes of Singapore Curious about the mosquitoes of Singapore? Read on for more information about our most common mosquito genera (groups): Aedes, Culex, and Anopheles. All three genera contain members that can transmit disease.  Aedes  The two most common Aedes species in Singapore are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.  The two species look similar, with black and white stripes on their bodies and legs. However, we can differentiate them by their scale patterns. Aedes aegypti has two white bands on its thorax (back) in the shape of a lyre, whereas Aedes albopictus has one white central band.  Typical breeding habitats include artificial or natural water containers/bodies such as flower pots, clogged roof gutters, and household water storage containers. Aedes albopictus also breeds in areas with a lot of greenery, and natural habitats such as tree holes and dry leaves. Both species bite primarily during the day, but can also bite at night in well-lit areas. Both species can transmit dengue, although Aedes albopictus does so less efficiently than Aedes aegypti. Culex  The most common Culex species in Singapore’s urban setting is Culex quinquefasciatus.  Culex quinquefasciatus is a golden-brown mosquito with a dark proboscis. Typical breeding habitats include blocked drains. Culex quinquefasciatus bites during the night and is a vector of Japanese encephalitis and filariasis (not endemic in Singapore). Anopheles  The two most common Anopheles species in Singapore are Anopheles epiroticus and Anopheles sinensis.  Anopheles epiroticus and Anopheles sinensis are light brown mosquitoes, with pale and dark scales on their legs, proboscises and wings. Typical breeding habitats include sunlit brackish pools with algae. Both species bite during the night and are vectors of malaria (not endemic in Singapore).  Laying the Foundation for Project Wolbachia Before performing any field releases, NEA first conducted several years of extensive groundwork to assess the feasibility and safety of Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology for use in Singapore, consult a wide range of stakeholders, and raise awareness of the technology.  Laboratory feasibility studies NEA conducted rigorous lab studies to ensure that our male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes were suitable for release, and that they would be effective at suppressing Aedes aegypti populations. Today, these checks are still performed on a regular basis to confirm that our Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes demonstrate the following properties:  Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) This phenomenon, induced by Wolbachia, causes sterile matings between Wolbachia-carrying males and non-Wolbachia-carrying females. Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology exploits CI to suppress Aedes aegypti populations. Maternal transmission of Wolbachia We perform regular checks to ensure that the Wolbachia-Aedes females in our lab colony continue to pass the Wolbachia bacterium down to their offspring, so that all our released male mosquitoes carry Wolbachia. Mating competitiveness Wolbachia-Aedes males we release must be able to compete with urban males to mate with urban Aedes aegypti females. In the lab, we check to make that the mass-production process and the presence of Wolbachia does not affect their mating competitiveness. Risk assessment NEA conducted comprehensive internal and independent risk assessment of Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology, determining it to be safe, with no risk to human health and insignificant risk to ecology. This conclusion is consistent with findings from other groups around the world. Refer to the NEA website for detailed risk assessment reports.  Community engagement NEA considers community engagement to be critical for the success of Project Wolbachia – Singapore. Well before field releases began, NEA conducted extensive community engagement to raise awareness of Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology and to consult a wide range of stakeholders, including study site residents, the general public, the medical and scientific community, and government agencies. Community engagement remains a key part of Project Wolbachia – Singapore today.  Automation and Partnerships to Scale Capacity Partnerships to scale capacity  To support expansion of the project, NEA will be increasing the production of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes from about 2 million males per week to 5 million males per week. Increased capacity for expansion of Project Wolbachia is made possible by NEA’s collaboration with our partners Orinno Technology Pte. Ltd. (Orinno), Verily Life Sciences (Verily), and the National Robotics Programme, which is a multi-agency national programme that looks at the end-to-end development of differentiating robotic enablers and solutions in Singapore.  Orinno co-develops engineering solutions for the mass production and release of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes using automation and Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). Verily complements NEA’s mosquito production and release efforts and has contributed to the gender-sorting and release of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes at the Tampines and Marine Parade study sites.  Evolution of automated systems for large-scale rearing of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes Novel automated modules have been developed and replaced previous manual production processes to improve consistency, productivity and scalability of large-scale rearing and field releases of quality male mosquitoes. As of June 2022, nine modules have been developed and have substantially improved productivity, standardised production quality, and enhanced workers’ health and safety by reducing or eliminating reliance on repetitive manual processing. Overall, the technological developments have improved the efficiency of mosquito production by up to 40 times as compared manual processes. This has also allowed Project Wolbachia – Singapore to increase the production of stable high-quality mosquitoes and expand to more areas to fight against dengue.  Phase 1 Small-Scale Field Study Phase 1 field study NEA carried out Phase 1 small-scale releases in Braddell Heights (landed residential area) and Tampines West and Nee Soon East (HDB). These sites are representative of housing estates in Singapore, and had previously experienced dengue outbreaks and high Aedes aegypti populations. Prior to Phase 1, NEA had been monitoring mosquito populations in these sites for up to three years, thereby establishing a baseline against which to compare the impact of releases.  Phase 1 findings Phase 1 gave us important information on the behaviour of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes in our urban environment, which then guided the design of subsequent release strategies.  Flight range: 90% of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes were caught within 40m from the release point. Male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes released on the ground floor of HDB blocks could be caught on higher levels, even on top floors. Longevity: 50% of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes survived to four days after release. Potential to suppress urban Aedes aegypti populations: At the end of Phase 1, egg hatch rates and adult Aedes aegypti populations in release sites were reduced by 50% compared to sites with no releases. This suggested that released males successfully mated with urban females; optimisation of release methods is now needed to achieve better suppression. Phase 1 also helped us identify the following challenges: Migration of females into release sites: In Singapore’s dense urban environment, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from adjacent areas can easily move into the release sites, thus reducing the impact of releases. High-rise mosquito breeding: Ground-floor releases were not effective at reducing Aedes aegypti numbers on the upper floors of HDB blocks. Release of small numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes females: Although only a very small number of female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes slip through the sorting process, successive releases over time may result in establishment of Wolbachia in the urban Aedes aegypti population. This would reduce the effectiveness of the Wolbachia-Aedes suppression strategy, which relies on incompatible matings between Wolbachia-carrying males and urban females.  Phase 2 Field Study Phase 2 field study In Phase 2, NEA set out to improve our release methods and address challenges identified in Phase 1. Phase 2 was carried out in Tampines West and Nee Soon East, and involved:  Expansion of release sites  and inclusion of buffer zone releases, which counteract migration of females into release sites. High-floor releases in addition to ground-floor releases. Low-dose X-ray irradiation of sorted pupae to sterilise residual females and prevent establishment of Wolbachia in the urban Aedes aegypti population. Our Impact assessment determined that X-ray irradiation poses no harm to humans or the environment. Phase 2 findings Phase 2 achieved 70-80% suppression of the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the release sites, an improvement over Phase 1. Better results were achieved with the expansion of the release sites and the inclusion of buffer releases, suggesting that larger sites are less affected by the impact of migration. High-floor releases resulted in a better vertical distribution of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes in HDB blocks. The use of low-dose X-ray irradiation to sterilise residual females was effective at preventing establishment of Wolbachia in the field.  Phase 3 Field Study In Phase 3, the Tampines West and Nee Soon East study sites were further expanded  to determine if suppression could be sustained over larger areas. Phase 3 covered about four times the number of HDB blocks as Phase 1. Phase 3 findings Phase 3 achieved >90% suppression of the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the study sites, again suggesting that larger sites yield better results. Releases kept the Aedes aegypti populations at levels that pose low dengue risk. In some areas where continued releases had already suppressed the Aedes aegypti population, we were able to reduce the number of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes released and still maintain good suppression.  Phase 4 Field Study Phase 4 field study In Phase 4, NEA further expanded the study sites beyond Tampines West and Nee Soon East to cover more areas in Tampines and Yishun. The Phase 4 release sites cover about seven times the number of HDB blocks as Phase 1. This expansion allowed NEA to continue to develop and test release tactics for use in future deployment efforts.  Phase 4 findings Ongoing releases have kept urban Aedes aegypti populations at levels that pose low dengue risk for more than a year—an unprecedentedly long period of low mosquito population for these areas. This has allowed NEA to reduce the number of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes released while still maintaining suppression. Along with the 90% reduction in mosquito population, NEA’s preliminary analysis also showed that in 2019, there were 65-80% less dengue cases in the Tampines and Yishun release sites, compared to areas without release.  Phase 5 Field Study From July 2020, NEA will gradually expand releases of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti (Wolbachia-Aedes) mosquitoes to the entire HDB towns of Yishun and Tampines and cover both towns by March 2022. With this roll-out, NEA will determine if suppression across whole towns can be sustained with fewer male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Release schedule  Preliminary results As of April 2022, releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes have expanded to cover the entire towns of Tampines and Yishun (1,473 blocks, 142,402 households).  The positive outcome of the field studies at Tampines and Yishun show that continued releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes can successfully suppress the female urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population. Up to 98% of suppression of the Aedes aegypti mosquito population was observed at the core of study sites. The heat map below shows the “eraser effect”, where previously dark red areas (indicating high Aedes aegypti mosquito population) gradually faded to low mosquito population after releases. Up to 88% of reduction in dengue cases was observed at core areas of the study sites with at least one year of releases.  While most areas at the study sites showed good suppression of the Aedes aegypti mosquito population within three to four months after beginning releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes, environmental factors such as close proximity to non-release areas with persistently high Aedes aegypti mosquitoes populations can delay the effect of such releases. With very low Aedes aegypti wild type mosquito populations, the presence of female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes could result in these Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes propagating in the field. The eggs from a pair of mated Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are viable and can hatch, resulting in Wolbachia-carrying offspring.  These female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes in the community are less harmful than urban Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, because they are partially resistant to dengue infection and do not transmit dengue well. The additional technique of X-ray irradiation was introduced to sterilise the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes, which successfully reduced the urban Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito population.   Field Study to Test Targeted Release Strategy Field study to test targeted release strategy Targeted release strategy in HDB estates Since May 2020, NEA expanded releases of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti (Wolbachia-Aedes) mosquitoes to selected dengue high-risk neighbourhoods in Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong, Hong Kah North, and Bukit Gombak. These neighbourhoods were selected due to their consistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito populations.  This targeted approach, which zeroes in on high-risk areas, differs from the “rolling” approach adopted in Yishun and Tampines, where release sites were gradually expanded to adjacent neighbourhoods.   Preliminary findings Ongoing releases in parts of Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong and Hong Kah North constituencies have reduced the urban Aedes aegypti populations, with most areas having fewer than 10 mosquitoes caught per 100 traps per week. The heat map below shows the “eraser effect”, where previously dark red areas (indicating high Aedes aegypti mosquito population) gradually faded to low mosquito population from May/June 2020 to March 2022.  With the promising results, NEA expanded and carried out releases at other high-risk areas in Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok towns in Oct 2021 and May 2022. The targeted strategy in these areas remain unchanged, which means releases will be conducted on pockets of areas with perennially high Aedes aegypti mosquito populations and persistent dengue transmission.   Targeted release strategy in landed estate Following the good results of Project Wolbachia in high-rise residential HDB estates, NEA has expanded releases to the Marine Parade landed estate area. This study will help NEA develop strategy and tactics for the use of Wolbachia technology in high-risk landed estates.  Vans equipped with release automation technology are deployed to conduct releases. The use of van releases is part of NEA’s efforts to incorporate automation into releases so that we can cover larger areas more effectively as Project Wolbachia scales up.  Since April 2021, NEA has conducted mosquito trap studies and small-scale trial releases to collect data in preparation for the large-area releases. Residents were engaged and volunteers hosted different mosquito traps in their homes for mosquito surveillance.  Targeted release strategy in construction sites As part of the expansion, releases will also be carried out at construction sites within the study sites. NEA is working with relevant stakeholders, including construction companies, to guide them on the surveillance and release of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes at such premises. This is part of our strategy to achieve better suppression at the study sites, by covering different terrains and landscapes.  Multi-site field study In July 2022, NEA expanded releases of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (Wolbachia-Aedes) to cover an additional 1,400 HDB blocks and 154,606 households. This is part of a 2-year study to determine the impact of the Wolbachia technology on reducing dengue cases.  The sites selected were based on a set of criteria:  historical dengue risk level (2016 to 2020) Aedes aegypti population size and landscape of the area NEA’s capacity for producing and releasing male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Refer to the NEA website for the location maps of the study sites   Wolbachia-Aedes Release Schedule The information provided in this map is from Apr 2024.  (Map showing areas where male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are being released to fight dengue)  Releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes to suppress Aedes aegypti mosquito population  Male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes will be released will be conducted twice a week, as indicated in the schedule below. This schedule is subject to changes (e.g. due to public holidays).  Residents may see more mosquitoes during the release period, but these male mosquitoes released do not bite or transmit disease. Wolbachia is safe. Stay vigilant and continue to keep your premises free from mosquito breeding.  Refer to the NEA website for more information on Project Wolbachia – Singapore.

How does Project Wolbachia – Singapore work?  NEA has been conducting field releases of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti (Wolbachia-Aedes) mosquitoes to suppress urban Aedes aegypti mosquito populations, the main vector for dengue, in parts of Singapore. When these male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes mate with female urban Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (without Wolbachia), their resultant eggs do not hatch. Continued releases lead to a decline in the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and therefore, reduce the risk of dengue transmission.  2.    Is NEA introducing a new mosquito species into the environment?  NEA is not introducing a new mosquito species into the environment. The male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes released by NEA are of the same Aedes aegypti mosquito species found in the environment. The only difference is that male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes carry the Wolbachia bacterium, which is safe and occurs naturally in more than 60% of insect species.  3.    Are Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes genetically modified?  Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are not genetically modified, as no changes have been made to their genetic material.  4.    Is Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology safe?  NEA has conducted a thorough risk assessment of Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology and has found the technology to be safe, with no identified risk to human health and no significant risk to ecology. The conclusion is consistent with findings from other research groups around the world, and with the findings of an independent research company. NEA’s rigorous evaluation process involved in-house research, critical reviews of existing knowledge and research, and consultations with various overseas and local experts and stakeholders such as academic researchers, medical and healthcare professionals, and non-governmental organisations.  5.    How can I recognise male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes?  Male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes look the same as urban male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the community. Male mosquitoes are smaller and have more bushy antennae compared to female mosquitoes. Male mosquitoes (regardless of whether they carry Wolbachia) do not bite or transmit disease, and feed only on plant juices such as nectar for survival and energy. On the other hand, female mosquitoes bite as they need blood to produce eggs.  6.    Will the release of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes affect insects other than Aedes aegypti mosquitoes?  The release of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes is specifically aimed at suppressing urban Aedes aegypti mosquito populations by leveraging Wolbachia, a bacterium that naturally occurs in more than 60% of insect species. When these male mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (without Wolbachia), the resulting eggs do not hatch. This species-specific suppression effect means that other insect species, including other mosquito species, remain unaffected. While studies have shown that mating may occasionally occur naturally between Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, this occurrence is not frequent enough to impact Aedes albopictus mosquito populations.  Project Wolbachia – Singapore field studies 7.   Where are the Project Wolbachia – Singapore study sites located, and how has the project expanded since its inception?  Project Wolbachia will increase coverage from 480,000 to 580,000 households from October 2024 to Q1 2025.  Field studies commenced in 2016 in selected areas of Yishun and Tampines towns, and by April 2022, had expanded to cover the entirety of both towns. In May 2020, NEA initiated a new approach, conducting targeted releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes in dengue high-risk residential areas within Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok towns.  Moving beyond HDB residential estates, NEA has also been studying the use of Wolbachia technology for dengue high-risk landed residential estates and construction sites within the study areas since April 2022.  A Multi-Site Field Study to determine the impact of the Project on dengue cases started in July 2022 covering 8 study sites, namely Bedok North, Bedok Reservoir, Geylang - MacPherson, Hougang, Punggol, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yew Tee.  The expansion in Q1 2024 covers five residential sites in the South of Singapore, comprising both HDB and landed estates. The five locations are Bukit Merah – Telok Blangah, Clementi – West Coast, Commonwealth, Holland and Marine Parade – Mountbatten.  Following positive results, NEA is expanding the coverage to five more sites. This includes Hougang Serangoon Central, Serangoon North, Jurong East, and Jurong West from Oct 2024 onwards.  Summary of Release Areas  Pilot Sites  Study Sites	No. of Households (as of Oct 2024)	Remarks Tampines	71,400	Releases since 2016, reached full town coverage by April 2022 Yishun	69,600	Releases since 2016, reached full town coverage by April 2022 Choa Chu Kang	31,200	Releases since May 2022, targeted high-risk areas Bukit Batok	12,100	Releases since June 2022, targeted high-risk areas Marine Parade	18,500	Releases since April 2022, first landed estate Multi-Site Field Study (Release since July 2022):  Study Sites	No. of Households (as of Oct 2024) Bedok North	30,000 Bedok Reservoir	12,100 Geylang – MacPherson	10,100 Hougang	16,300 Punggol	21,700 Sengkang	21,500 Woodlands	25,400 Yew Tee	15,300 Expansion (Release from Q1 2024):  Study Sites	No. of Households (as of Oct 2024) Bukit Merah – Telok Blangah	48,200 Clementi – West Coast	27,700 Commonwealth	22,100 Holland	1,400 Marine Parade – Mountbatten	23,300 Expansion (Release from October 2024 onwards):  Sites	No. of Households (as of Oct 2024) Hougang	22,200 Serangoon Central	12,600 Serangoon North	8,900 Jurong East	17,800 Jurong West	25,400 8.    How were sites chosen for the field studies? What is NEA doing differently at each study site?  Sites are selected to receive Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito releases based on multiple considerations, including historical dengue risk, Aedes aegypti mosquito population, size and landscape of the area, and NEA’s capacity. Historical dengue risk, but not ongoing dengue data, was used for site selection as the dengue situation at existing clusters is dynamic and may not reflect future risks of dengue outbreak in the area.  NEA is testing different release approaches and tactics, to determine the most optimal strategies for wider deployment and implementation of Project Wolbachia in an effective and sustainable way. At Yishun and Tampines, NEA has adopted a rolling carpet approach in which releases are gradually expanded to eventually cover entire towns. At Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok, NEA is testing a more targeted strategy, focusing on neighbourhoods with consistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. The Multi-Site Field Study at the eight selected sites aims to collect more data through larger-scale field trials, to build on our understanding of the impact of Wolbachia technology on reducing dengue cases in Singapore. In selected areas, NEA, together with our partner Debug by Alphabet (“Debug”), is using vans equipped with release automation technology to conduct releases. The use of van releases is part of NEA’s efforts to incorporate automation into releases, so that we can cover larger areas more effectively as Project Wolbachia scales up.  NEA will also study if this technology could curtail the growth of existing transmission in large dengue clusters in 2025.  9.    There are areas outside the study sites with active dengue clusters, is NEA able to extend Wolbachia-Aedes releases to these areas and curb dengue transmission as well?  In 2025, NEA will study if the Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology could curtail the growth of existing transmission in large dengue clusters. Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes will be deployed at such clusters in HDB estates to supplement existing dengue cluster control operations. As it typically takes about three to six months of releases to achieve significant reductions in mosquito population, the Wolbachia-Aedes releases may not show immediate impact on dengue transmissions but may have the potential to limit the growth of prolonged dengue clusters. NEA will decide to enter a dengue cluster based on NEA’s production capacity, the Aedes aegypti population in the area as well as dengue cluster dynamics, such as number of cases and growth rate.  Nonetheless, Project Wolbachia is not a silver bullet solution to stem dengue transmission in Singapore. While the technology has shown to be effective in reducing the Aedes aegypti population and the risk of dengue transmission in a local area, it is a complementary tool for dengue control. The key measures for outbreak or cluster control are the removal of mosquito breeding habitats, as well as the spraying of pesticides to kill the adult Aedes population, including infected mosquitoes. Community action is critical to curb the transmission of dengue.  10.    Are there plans to expand Wolbachia-Aedes releases to condominiums?  There are currently no plans to conduct field studies in condominiums, but residents in condominiums within or adjacent to study sites may see male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes in their area and experience the positive spill-over effects.  11.    When is the Project Wolbachia field trial going to end? How long will releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes be conducted?  Project Wolbachia is a long-term project with clearly defined objectives in each phase, to enable the study to progress and the technology to be systematically evaluated. NEA’s data shows that some areas could achieve good suppression of the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population within 3 to 6 months following releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Releases may be stopped or reduced in areas where the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population has been suppressed to dengue low-risk levels. However, in areas where there may be more cryptic Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding in the community, more time may be required to see positive effects of the releases, or for mosquito population suppression to be sustained. This highlights the need for residents to regularly practice the B-L-O-C-K steps to complement ongoing efforts to suppress the presence of breeding habitats.  12.     How is NEA measuring the outcomes of the field studies? NEA’s islandwide network of Gravitraps allows us to monitor mosquito populations across Singapore. We use these Gravitraps to measure Aedes aegypti populations in our study sites, and hence assess the impact of releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes.  NEA also collaborates with the Ministry of Health, the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and the School of Biological Sciences of the Nanyang Technological University, the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health of the National University of Singapore, and the National University Health System to evaluate the impact of the Project on dengue.  13.  In some areas, vans are seen releasing Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Is this a new release strategy? A combination of van and manual releases is currently used in Tampines, Bukit Merah – Telok Blangah, Clementi – West Coast, Commonwealth, Holland and Marine Parade – Mountbatten sites with plans for further deployment in new areas in 2025. As Project Wolbachia scales up, the integration of automated release mechanisms such as van releases will enable NEA to efficiently cover larger areas.  14.     Why are there still dengue cases in Project Wolbachia – Singapore study sites?  A small number of dengue cases may occasionally be reported within study sites. This could be due to the presence of low-level dengue transmission, or because cases living in the area were infected elsewhere. However, due to the low Aedes aegypti population in the study sites brought about by the releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes, we have seen limited dengue transmission and therefore significantly fewer dengue cases in study sites compared to areas without releases.  15.    Can I kill mosquitoes at the Project Wolbachia – Singapore study sites?  You can continue with your usual mosquito control measures and kill the mosquitoes as you normally would, as it is difficult to tell the male and female mosquitoes apart. To prevent mosquito breeding, it’s important to regularly practice B-L-O-C-K.  16.   If male mosquitoes do not bite, why am I still getting bitten?  Project Wolbachia – Singapore only targets Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vectors for dengue transmission in Singapore, but not other mosquito species (such as Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus). Hence, you may still be bitten by such mosquitoes or other biting insects. Please remain vigilant and continue to Stop Dengue with B-L-O-C-K even if you are residing in a neighbourhood with Wolbachia coverage.  17.    If male mosquitoes do not bite, why are they still landing on me?  Male mosquitoes seek out females, which are likely to be found near people. Thus, although they do not bite, male mosquitoes may still be attracted to and land on you. Like females, male mosquitoes are attracted to a variety of cues produced by or associated with humans, including visual cues (e.g. light, colour, and movement); olfactory cues (e.g. carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and octenol); and thermal cues (temperature and moisture). Mosquito traps also use these attractants to lure mosquitoes. Refer to the NEA website to find out more.  18.    Has Project Wolbachia – Singapore made an impact on dengue cases in the study sites?  Aedes aegypti is the primary vector that drives dengue transmission in Singapore. Since the start of Project Wolbachia in 2016, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has observed positive outcomes across study sites. The results of a multi-site field study, which started since July 2022, indicate that residents living in these study sites are 75% less likely to be infected with dengue. This is the result of an 80 to 90% reduction of the Aedes aegypti mosquito population at the study sites.  19.  Why can’t we just deploy Wolbachia technology islandwide? Why are field trials taking so long?  NEA has been ramping up our male mosquito production and release capacity to enable the expansion of Project Wolbachia and to benefit more households. We are also expanding our repertoire of deployment strategies for different contexts, so as to further increase Wolbachia coverage in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.  As technologies for mass production of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are still evolving, NEA is working closely with our collaborators such as Debug by Alphabet (“Debug”) and Orinno Technology Pte Ltd to develop solutions which involves the development and maturation of expertise in integrating multi-technical disciplines, including biotechnology, engineering, and data analytics.  There are many lessons that NEA is still learning from the ongoing studies. This includes insights on how best to reduce the number and frequency of mosquito releases without affecting the suppression of urban Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the community. The ongoing studies will also help NEA to understand the impact of Wolbachia-Aedes technology on reducing dengue cases and to optimise the mosquito production scale that we need.  20.     If I stay within Project Wolbachia study area, does this mean there will not be any thermal fogging or other chemical control activities carried out?  Releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes will help in the reduction of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes but will not completely eliminate the dengue risk. In the event of high dengue transmission or large dengue clusters within the study sites, e.g. during the early phase of releases, dengue control operations will be implemented. These operations may include chemical control measures such as thermal fogging. In such cases, NEA will work with relevant stakeholders to deconflict the thermal fogging and Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito release schedules.   Risk assessment and mitigation 21.    How does NEA separate out male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes for release? Are any female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes released and what is the impact of this?  As male mosquito pupae are smaller than female pupae, male and female mosquitoes can be sorted by size at the pupal stage. This is done at our mosquito production facility. After sorting, male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito pupae are allowed to emerge as adult mosquitoes, which are then ready for release. NEA’s stringent quality control checks ensure that this sorting is done with high accuracy.  A very small number of female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes may be released along with the males. This will not result in increased biting, as the number of released females is insignificant compared to the natural population in the community. The ability of this small number of released females to transmit disease would also largely be blocked by Wolbachia.  However, female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito released could produce Wolbachia-carrying offspring in the field. A Wolbachia Aedes population in the field does not increase risk of dengue transmission but could hamper suppression effort due to loss of biological incompatibility between released males and females in the field. NEA takes the additional step of exposing pupae to low-dose X-ray irradiation to sterilise any residual females to prevent Wolbachia from establishing itself in the mosquito population.  22.   How does NEA ensure that large numbers of female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are not accidentally released?  NEA’s mosquito production facility implements stringent laboratory security and containment measures. These measures, together with regular quality-control checks of the sex-sorting process, will prevent the unintentional release of large numbers of female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes.  23.    If Aedes aegypti populations are suppressed or eliminated, will other mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus be able to take over and proliferate more?  Based on NEA EHI’s study, there is no evidence that the reduction of Aedes aegypti has allowed Aedes albopictus to proliferate more. Nevertheless, NEA continues to monitor Aedes albopictus populations using our Gravitrap surveillance system, which will allow us to pick up any unusual increases. To keep the populations of both Aedes species low, it is critical for the community to continue practising the B-L-O-C-K steps.  24.  What happens if residents become less vigilant about checking for and removing breeding habitats?  Wolbachia-Aedes suppression technology is not a silver bullet, and is intended to complement, not replace source reduction efforts. Diminished community efforts to reduce mosquito breeding may negate the effect of the releases and can lead to an increase in dengue cases. Under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act, anyone found breeding mosquitoes within their premises will be subjected to enforcement action, as they have created, caused or permitted the creation of conditions favourable for the harbouring of vectors. It is therefore critical for the public to remain vigilant and regularly practise the B-L-O-C-K steps, so that our neighbourhoods and homes can be kept free of mosquitoes and dengue.  Wolbachia programmes in other countries  25.    I have read that some countries are releasing female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Why is NEA not doing the same? Releases of both female and male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes are being piloted by disease control programmes in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, among other countries. This approach, known as the replacement strategy, aims to replace field mosquito populations with Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes, which have a reduced ability to transmit diseases such as dengue.  While NEA continues to monitor the results of these trials, we have after careful evaluation decided to focus on suppression strategy—the release of only male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes to suppress Aedes aegypti populations. The suppression strategy, which does not require the release of biting females, is aligned with our decades of emphasis on source reduction. Refer to the NEA website for more details on why NEA is focusing on the suppression strategy.  26.    Where else is Wolbachia-Aedes suppression programme being piloted?  Besides Singapore, Wolbachia-Aedes suppression programme has also been piloted by disease control programmes in China, Thailand, US, and the French Polynesia among other countries.  The table below provides examples of past and ongoing pilots of Wolbachia-Aedes suppression programmes. While a number of pilots have been successful, there are as yet no reports of large-scale deployment.

Issues with the long-distance transport of Wolbachia-Aedes from California to the treatment site resulted in sub-optimal performance from the mosquitoes.  Mosquito Traps  Mosquito traps are good tools for surveillance and research  Effectiveness of mosquito traps is limited, and depends on the attractants used  Source reduction, or the removal of mosquito breeding and breeding habitats, is the key to bringing down the mosquito population and dengue cases   Mosquito traps have limits for disease control. The right mosquito traps may control the mosquito population, when used with an effective combination of attractants. However in the Singapore context, with abundant competing hosts and breeding habitats, mosquito traps may help to reduce the biting pressure, but may not protect people from disease.  Mosquito Traps for Surveillance and Research Mosquito traps are good tools for surveillance and research Mosquito traps have been regularly and effectively used for surveillance and research, to monitor the mosquito population, species, etc. The traps can be characterised as:  Active traps – these rely on visual cues (such as light and colour), olfactory cues (such as carbon dioxide and octenol) or thermal cues (such as temperature and moisture) to lure mosquitoes into the traps; or  Passive traps – these do not rely on attractants, but merely suck in passing mosquitoes. Active Traps Active traps are generally designed to attract and trap female mosquitoes that are either:  Looking for a site to lay their eggs (oviposition traps); or Looking for a blood meal (host-seeking traps). Oviposition Traps Oviposition traps capture the eggs laid by female mosquitoes. The eggs are able to develop through the larval and pupal stages, but the emergent adults are unable to escape through the wire mesh and thus drown. A large number of such traps must be deployed, as Aedes mosquitoes skip-oviposit and lay their eggs at many different sites.  Host-seeking Traps Female mosquitoes bite humans and animals (hosts) and blood feed, as they need the protein from blood for development of their eggs. Host-seeking female mosquitoes are attracted to: carbon dioxide (CO2), lactic acid, octenol, light, colour, movement, temperature and moisture. Host-seeking traps are therefore designed to mimic these attractive characteristics of the host, and thus lure the female mosquitoes into the traps. Some of the host-seeking traps commonly used for surveillance and research are listed below.   Passive Traps Passive traps do not rely on attractants to lure mosquitoes. These traps collect mosquitoes that happen to fly past at close range. An example of a passive trap is the fan-based trap.  Fan-based Trap Fan-based traps do not require chemical attractants or artificial baits. The design typically comprises a mesh attached to the front of a fan, which is then placed in an area where mosquitoes are attracted (e.g. where people congregate). Mosquitoes are drawn into and trapped in a bag, which is usually emptied once a week.  Effectiveness of Mosquito Traps Effectiveness of mosquito traps is limited, and depends on the attractants used Commercially available traps often incorporate specific olfactory, visual and thermal cues to attract female mosquitoes looking for blood meals. These attractants are usually used in combination, and the effectiveness of mosquito traps are dependent on the effectiveness of the attractants, strategic placement of traps, and regular maintenance of the traps.  Olfactory Cues  Carbon Dioxide  Mosquitoes can detect increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the air when seeking hosts for blood feeding. Many commercial mosquito traps are therefore designed to produce plumes of carbon dioxide to mimic human exhalation. These traps produce carbon dioxide either through the combustion of propane, or by using dry ice and carbon dioxide cylinders, which require regular and proper maintenance. Some products claim to emit carbon dioxide produced by photo-catalytic reactions, although these claims have not been validated. All mosquito species are attracted to carbon dioxide-baited traps.   Lactic acid  Lactic acid, is a chemical compound commonly found in sweat after exercising or after having a meal that is high in salt or potassium. Earlier studies have indicated a positive correlation between levels of lactic acid on human skin and attractiveness to anthropophilic (human-seeking) mosquito species such as Aedes aegypti. Studies have also shown that lactic acid, when combined with other substances such as carbon dioxide and ammonia, could potentially increase the effectiveness of mosquito traps.   Octenol  Octenol is a substance that can be found in perspiration and breath, and is formed when linoleic acid is broken down by the body. Mosquito antennae are capable of picking up more than 340 chemical odours produced by human skin, including octenol. Thus, some traps use octenol lures to attract mosquitoes. Octenol cartridges or strips in the mosquito traps must be replaced regularly to remain effective.   Pheromone  Anthropophilic mosquitoes have specialised semiochemical receptors on their antennae, which can be used to detect semiochemicals such as pheromones, at close range. Studies have shown that semiochemicals influence the preference of the oviposition sites of gravid female mosquitoes, which are looking to lay eggs. When female mosquitoes lay their eggs, they also deposit mosquito pheromones to signal and help other gravid mosquitoes identify safe breeding sites. Studies have also revealed that gravid females have a preference to lay eggs in water with conspecific larvae (larvae of the same species ).  Visual Cues  Light  Mosquitoes have two light-sensitive simple eyes. Traps using light as a visual cue are effective for mosquitoes that are active and bite at night, such as Culex and Anopheles species. Such traps are not effective for capturing Aedes aegypti (the primary vector for Dengue and Zika viruses), which is predominately a daytime biter.  Colour  Diurnally active mosquitoes, such as Aedes species, are believed to have better developed colour sensitivity than nocturnally active mosquitoes such as Culex species. Studies have shown that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have spectral sensitivity, ranging from ultraviolet to orange-coloured light. Studies have also demonstrated that orange-lighted targets, such as lamposts, attract host-seeking Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Gravid female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes also have a preference for black ovitraps when seeking oviposition sites.  Movement  Mosquitoes have compound eyes made up of hundreds of tiny lenses, designed for spotting movement and distinguishing prey, particularly useful for day-biters like Aedes aegypti, which may rely more on visual cues. Movement cues, at closer range, are usually effective in combination with olfactory cues, which attract mosquitoes from a longer range. When a mosquito following the olfactory cues comes nearer, it senses the movement of the host and targets it.  Thermal Cues  Temperature and Moisture  Mosquitoes use thermal sensory information to detect body heat and moisture at close range, when seeking a warm-blooded host. The maxillary palpus located on the mosquito head is believed to be sensitive to heat, helping the mosquito to locate warm-blooded prey and pinpoint capillaries that are closest to the skin and thus easy to reach. Studies have shown that mosquitoes have a preference for warmer objects at human body temperature, compared to cooler objects at room temperature.  Source Reduction is Key Source reduction, or the removal of mosquito breeding and breeding habitats, is the key to bringing down the mosquito population and dengue cases When used widely, the right mosquito traps may help to reduce the biting pressure, but would not be able to control the mosquito population or reduce the spread of disease in Singapore. This is because: Humans are much more attractive than mosquito traps, and emit all attractants in the right combination and proportions. Due to the high population density in Singapore, there are ample hosts for mosquitoes to blood feed upon, thus host-seeking mosquito traps would need to be extremely attractive to compete. Breeding habitats found in the environment are both abundant and attractive. Due to the warm tropical climate in Singapore, providing a very naturally conducive mosquito breeding environment, oviposition traps would need to be highly attractive as well as deployed in large enough numbers to compete. Thus with such competition from hosts and the natural environment in Singapore, mosquito traps would only be able to capture a small proportion of the mosquito population. The best way to control the mosquito population and bring down disease cases is source reduction, or the removal of mosquito breeding and breeding habitats.  Dengue Dengue fever is spread though the bite of the Aedes mosquito.  To prevent dengue fever, you must therefore prevent the breeding of the Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are identified by the black and white stripes on their bodies. You can get rid of the Aedes mosquito by frequently checking and removing stagnant water in your home.  Preventing Aedes mosquito breeding.  Dengue Cases It is important to note that the day-to-day numbers fluctuate, as they depend on the number of cases notified each day. Therefore, weekly numbers are a better reflection of actual trends.

Fast rate of dengue transmission has been observed in the 85-case cluster at Hougang Avenue 1. Persistent transmission has been noted in the cluster at Jalan Chengam/Sembawang Hills Drive (95 cases).  Among the four Dengue virus serotypes circulating in Singapore, Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) has been predominant since September 2023, with prior periodic dominance of DENV-1 and DENV-3 in 2023. Our population’s immunity to all four Dengue virus serotypes remains low. The continued presence of all these dengue risk factors may lead to a potential surge in dengue cases, if insufficient action is taken.  Four isolated Zika cases have been reported in 2025 to date. There are currently no Zika clusters.  With presence of the Aedes mosquito vector in Singapore, everyone is urged to maintain vigilance and play his part to prevent further localised disease transmission, through regularly practising the following Mozzie Wipeout ‘B-L-O-C-K’ steps:  ‘B-L-O-C-K’ steps Break up hardened soil Lift and empty flowerpot plates Overturn pails and wipe their rims Change water in vases Keep roof gutters clear and place BTI insecticide inside  Collective community action and vigilance are critical to help prevent a surge in dengue and Zika cases. All stakeholders and the community are urged to take immediate action to remove stagnant water from our environment and maintain good housekeeping, to deprive mosquitoes of potential breeding habitats. Residents are urged to allow NEA officers to inspect their premises and conduct spraying of insecticide, to enable immediate removal of adult mosquitoes to stop dengue and Zika transmission.  Everyone, especially those residing in dengue clusters, should use insect repellent and carry out other ‘S-A-W’ actions, to protect themselves from being bitten by the Aedes mosquito. Individuals diagnosed with or suspected to be infected with dengue are also advised to avoid further mosquito bites, by using insect repellent and carrying out S-A-W actions, to prevent passing on the dengue virus to mosquitoes and other people in their neighbourhoods.  ‘S-A-W’ steps Spray insecticide in dark corners around the house Apply insect repellent regularly Wear long-sleeve tops and long pants  Repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), picaridin or IR3535 as the active ingredient, are the most effective in repelling mosquitoes. For more information, please refer to the ‘Guidelines on the use of Mosquito Repellent Spray’.  Persons showing symptoms suggestive of dengue or Zika infections should see a medical practitioner early, to be diagnosed and managed accordingly. Early diagnosis can facilitate better case management. Those with dengue or Zika infection should apply mosquito repellent regularly, so that mosquitoes do not bite and pick up the virus from them before biting someone else, thus reducing further disease transmission.  Symptoms suggestive of dengue infection include:  Sudden onset of fever for two to seven days Severe headache with retro-orbital (behind the eye) pain Muscle pain Skin rashes Nausea and vomiting Bleeding from the nose or gums Easy bruising of the skin Symptoms suggestive of Zika infection include:  Rash Fever Conjunctivitis (red eyes) Muscle pain Joint pain Headache Although rare, Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly in unborn babies of pregnant women. While there is currently no evidence that pregnant women are more likely to get the Zika virus infection, the consequences can be more serious if a pregnant woman is infected. Pregnant women with symptoms of possible Zika virus infection should seek medical attention immediately and consult their Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) doctor.  Men who are confirmed positive for Zika should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least three months after recovery.  Please visit the Ministry of Health’s website for more information on Dengue and Zika.  The latest updates can also be found on the NEA website, and myENV app.  Dengue Community Alert System NEA launched the Dengue Community Alert System to display colour-coded (purple, red, yellow or green) banners. Residents living in dengue cluster areas and areas with high Aedes mosquito population are at higher risk of getting dengue. Download myENV app or visit go.gov.sg/dengue-high-risk to receive alerts on high Aedes mosquito population and dengue clusters near you. Zika The Zika virus can be spread through the bite of an infective female Aedes mosquito, and the key to reducing Zika virus transmission lies in its prevention and control. Premises owners should undertake vector control measures regularly, and residents can get rid of the Aedes mosquito by frequently checking and removing stagnant water in your home and immediate surroundings.  People infected with Zika should apply repellent and wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants, to prevent mosquitoes from biting them and picking up the virus from them, and subsequently transmitting the virus to other people.  Read more on Zika and its symptoms, number of Zika cases, and preventing Aedes mosquito breeding.   Zika Cases and Clusters No new Zika cases have been reported in Singapore since 04 March 2025. However, it is important for everyone to remain vigilant and take precautions to prevent spread of the Zika virus, such as by doing S-A-W and B-L-O-C-K actions. NEA will continue to monitor the situation closely and work together with our partners.   Areas with Higher Aedes aegypti Mosquito Population The information provided in this map is from March 2025.  The female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of dengue and Zika in Singapore. The Aedes aegypti mosquito thrives in our urban environment, which provides it with numerous habitats to lay its eggs in, and hosts to blood feed upon.  An incidence or outbreak of dengue, Zika or other mosquito-borne disease, is related to the simultaneous occurrence of the mosquito vector, circulating virus, and susceptibility of the human population. Dengue is endemic in Singapore, and areas with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population may have a higher risk of dengue transmission, especially during the dengue season.  Residents living in areas with relatively higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population are urged to help reduce the mosquito population by regularly practising the Mozzie Wipeout, and reminding their families, friends and neighbours to remove stagnant water from within and around their homes.  Stakeholders including Town Councils (TCs) are encouraged to use the data to prioritise their dengue prevention and control measures, and target areas with high mosquito population.  Residents must be vigilant even if their area is not highlighted as having a high Aedes aegypti mosquito population. Low risk does not mean no risk; one female mosquito can lay 300 eggs in her short lifespan, thus the localised population can expand very quickly.  Surveillance of the Aedes aegypti Mosquito Population with Gravitraps NEA has deployed about 72,000 Gravitraps at public and landed housing estates around Singapore.  Picture of Gravitraps  The Gravitrap, developed by NEA’s Environmental Health Institute (EHI), is designed to attract and trap female Aedes adult mosquitoes that are looking for sites to lay their eggs in. Female Aedes mosquitoes attempting to lay their eggs in the traps will be captured and prevented from biting other people. The Gravitrap also traps and prevents the emergence of any mosquitoes from eggs that are laid in the trap.  Use Of Mosquito Repellents Mosquito repellents are substances or chemicals that interfere with mosquitoes’ host-seeking ability.  Using mosquito repellent safely and correctly can protect you from mosquito bites. Refer to the Guidelines on the use of Mosquito Repellent for more information.  There are two types of mosquito repellents: topical repellents and spatial repellents. When using mosquito repellents, it is important to always follow the directions and safety precautions on the product labels.   Topical Repellents Topical repellents are applied directly onto the skin or clothing; they provide a “barrier” against mosquitoes. For maximum protection, topical repellents should be applied to all exposed skin but avoid your eyes and mouth.  A wide variety of topical repellents are available in different formulations and concentrations. Studies have shown that repellent containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), picaridin or IR3535 are more effective and/or have longer mosquito-repelling effects than “natural” repellents that use plant-based extracts, such as citronella, eucalyptus and other essential oils. Products registered with NEA will bear a unique registration mark, comprising a unique registration number in the form of ‘SINNEA-X-XXX/XXX/XXXX’ and a registration logo.  Read the product labels and recommendation on protection time and choose the one that meet your needs. Important considerations that will affect the efficacy of topical repellents include sweat, contact of treated skin with water or rubbing of skin on clothing. Re-apply the repellent according to the manufacturer’s instructions on the product label.  General guidelines for the use of topical repellents safely:  Always check the label and use the repellent according to manufacturer's instructions. Test repellent on a small area of skin ﬁrst (e.g. inside of elbow), to ensure no allergic reactions. Do not over-apply, use just enough to cover exposed skin and clothing. If you need to use sunscreen, apply sunscreen first followed by repellent. Do not use expired products. Do not apply repellent on skin with cuts, wounds, or any skin irritation. Wash hands with soap immediately after each application. Dispense the product onto your hands before carefully applying onto your face, avoiding eyes and mouth.  Spatial Repellents Spatial repellents emit chemicals, which repel mosquitoes, from devices that can be worn or used within a space near people. These devices include mosquito coils, heat-activated vaporisers/mats and emanators. The chemicals dispersed in the air generate a space that repel mosquitoes.  Spatial repellents that emit chemicals, such as metofluthrin, transfluthrin, prallethrin and D- or D-trans allethrin, have been shown to be effective in preventing mosquito bites. Nonetheless, the extent of effectiveness or protection depend on the application platform/device and environmental conditions (i.e. windy conditions, physical activities) that may disrupt the “protected space” of spatial repellents. It is important to always follow the directions and safety precautions on the product labels.  General guidelines for the use of spatial repellents safely: Always check the label and use the repellent according to manufacturer's instructions. Avoid direct skin contact with the product as it may cause skin irritation. Wash hands with soap immediately after being in contact with the device. Exercise caution to prevent potential fire and electrical hazards of some products such as mosquito coils and electric vaporizers. Products should not be left unattended when in use. Do not use expired products. Avoid inhalation of fumes at close range, discontinue use if allergic reactions or breathing difficulty occur. Do not used in enclosed areas. For indoor use, ensure room is properly ventilated. Store product safely out of reach of children. Keep away from food stuff and animal feed. Read more on spatial repellents and its efficacy.  Prevent Aedes Mosquito Breeding Prevent Aedes mosquitoes breeding The viruses that cause dengue fever, chikungunya and zika are carried by the Aedes mosquito. As the bite of an infective Aedes mosquito spreads diseases, it is crucial to prevent its breeding.  The Aedes mosquito is easily identifiable by the distinctive black and white stripes on its body. It prefers to breed in clean, stagnant water easily found in our homes. You can get rid of the Aedes mosquito by following the Checklist For A Mozzie-Free Home and frequently checking and removing stagnant water in your premises.    Mozzie-proof your home The essential guide to mozzie-proofing your home from dengue.  This guide contains information on: 1. Common breeding spots and Mozzie Wipeout steps. 2. How to protect yourself from mozzie bites and useful information on insect repellents. 3. How to use the items in this toolkit.  Let’s do our part to prevent mosquito breeding in our homes.  Together, we can fight Dengue and keep our family members, neighbours and community safe.   Aedes Mosquito Under optimal conditions, the egg of an Aedes mosquito can hatch into a larva in less than a day. The larva then takes about four days to develop into a pupa, from which an adult mosquito will emerge after two days. Three days after the mosquito has bitten a person and taken in blood, it will lay eggs, and the cycle repeats.  Did you know? Only the female Aedes mosquito bites, as it needs the protein in blood for its eggs to develop. The mosquito becomes infective approximately seven days after it has bitten a person carrying the virus. This is the extrinsic incubation period, during which time the virus replicates in the mosquito and reaches the salivary glands. Peak biting is at dawn and dusk The average lifespan of an Aedes mosquito in nature is two weeks. The mosquito can lay eggs about three times in its lifetime, and about 100 eggs are produced each time. The eggs can lie dormant in dry conditions for up to about nine months, after which they can hatch if exposed to favourable conditions, such as water and food.

Avoid placing potted plants and other paraphernalia over the scupper drains.  ☐ Cover rarely used gully traps. Replace the gully trap with non-perforated ones and install anti mosquito valve.  ☐ Cover bamboo pole holders after use. Rainwater can potentially accumulate in these bamboo pole holders if they are uncovered and create a habitat.  ☐ Trays or receptacles should not be placed beneath or on top of any air-conditioning unit as they may create conditions favourable for mosquito breeding. If there is a need for installation of such trays to address other issues, premises owners should ensure that they install HDB’s patented air-conditioner trays. Regular checks and maintenance of the tray is still necessary to ensure there are no chokages at the drainage point that could result in water ponding.  EVERY OTHER DAY ☐ Remove water in plant pot plates. Clean and scrub the plate thoroughly to remove mosquito eggs. Avoid the use of plant pot plates, if possible.  ☐ Change water in flower vases. Clean and scrub the inner sides of vases. Wash roots of flowers and plants thoroughly as mosquito eggs can stick to them easily.  ONCE A WEEK ☐ Clear fallen leaves and stagnant water in your scupper drains and garden. These leaves could collect water or cause blockages to the drains, thus resulting in the buildup of stagnant water.  ☐ Clear any stagnant water in your air cooler unit.  ONCE A MONTH ☐ Add prescribed amounts of sand granular insecticide into vases, gully traps and roof gutters, even if they are dry.  ☐ Clear away fallen leaves in roof gutters and apron drains. If structurally feasible, remove the roof gutters.  Inspecting your homes and premises for mosquito habitats What do dengue inspection officers do when they enter your residence or premise? Upon obtaining permission to enter your home, our officer will: Inform that they would focus their checks at areas where there could be potential breeding habitats. Request that you accompany them on their inspection at all times. Provide advice on steps you can take to prevent mosquito breeding. Upon detection of mosquito breeding habitat, our officer will: Show the mosquito breeding habitat to you. Do not attempt to pour away the water with larvae or pupae. Show you an empty vial which will be used to collect a sample of the larvae or pupae. Collect a sample of the larvae or pupae into the vial. The vial will be sealed in your presence and sent to the laboratory for testing. Request for your identification as breeding of vectors is an offence under the law. If samples collected are those of mosquitoes or other vectors, a fine will be issued to you in due course. We will not request for any payment of fines on the spot.  Slide1 (2) How to identify NEA’s dengue inspection officers? Our officers will identify themselves with their NEA Authority Card and explain the purpose of their visit.  They will only enter your homes or premises with your consent and accompaniment. You may verify our officer's identity through NEA's website (www.nea.gov.sg/validate-officer) or call us at 6225 5632. Penalties that you may face if mosquito breeding is found in your home or premises If your premises are found with mosquito breeding, you may be fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned for a term not exceeding 3 months or both, under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act (CVPA).  If your place of residence is found with mosquito breeding, you may be issued a fine in the form of a Notice to Attend Court. Owners or occupiers of premises will be notified through mail if enforcement action will be taken.  Vector-Borne Diseases Research Programme EHI’s Vector-Borne Diseases Research Programme conducts field and laboratory research to gain a better understanding of vector-borne diseases that pose a threat to Singapore, and to develop tools for risk interventions.  Vector control and surveillance tools The programme continually explores new and safe tools for Singapore’s vector control programme. It is currently studying the feasibility of using Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti males to help suppress the Aedes mosquito population in Singapore, to further reduce the risk of dengue transmission. Wolbachia are naturally-occurring bacteria present in more than 60 per cent of insects. However, Aedes aegypti, the primary dengue-transmitting vector, does not carry the bacteria. When female mosquitoes from the field – which do not carry Wolbachia – mate with males that carry Wolbachia, the eggs derived from these matings do not hatch. Theoretically, releasing males carrying Wolbachia could lead to a reduction in the population of Aedes mosquitoes in the field.  Please Refer to the NEA website for more information on Wolbachia technology.  wolbachia_blk  Previously, the team developed the Gravitrapthat enabled the capture of both Aedes female adult mosquitoes and their eggs. Gravitraps are currently deployed at public housing estates in various parts of Singapore, to provide an overview of the mosquito density in different parts of Singapore. Gravitrap â€“ Aedes mosquito trap  The team also carries out tests on the efficacy of insecticides and the resistance of mosquitoes to them. Such tests are conducted in both the laboratory and field, to ensure that the insecticides used continue to be effective in mosquito control.  The institute also serves as a repository and reference for mosquito species present in Singapore. Through years of collection from various habitats, we have accumulated a comprehensive collection of mosquitoes that is carefully catalogued and filed for easy reference.  vector-borne diseases research  Understanding Disease Transmission The programme seeks to gain an understanding of disease transmission, through studying the dynamic interactions between the pathogen, the vector and the human host.  EHI’s high containment Arthropod Containment Levels 2 and 3 laboratories (ACL-2 and ACL-3) allow mosquito infection experiments to be conducted, to further our understanding of mosquito-pathogen interactions, and the potential impact on disease transmission. Molecular epidemiology, as a result of the mapping of pathogen genes and genomes in the context of disease epidemiology, has provided further insights into vector-borne disease transmission in Singapore and the region. Together with our study on the seroprevalence of disease-specific antibodies in the human population, the multi-disciplinary approach provides robust situational awareness and risk assessment.  Similarly to with the Surveillance and Epidemiology Programme, pathogens studied in this programme include the dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and malaria parasites.
